      What is SHHC trying to build?
      </h4>
      <p class="text-white">
      A strong community of sneaker connoisseurs that will come together to build something great.
We want to help members expand their network by connecting them with thousands of like-minded individuals.
Additionally, create a new way for sneakerheads to cop new releases because who likes taking countless L’s on drops.
Charity is a large part of this project, and we will take it upon ourselves to help our less fortunate sneakerhead friends.
